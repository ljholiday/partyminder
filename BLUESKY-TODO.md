# Bluesky Integration - Next Steps

## Current Status (Working)
- âœ… Bluesky connection persistence with automatic token refresh
- âœ… Event invitation modal with Bluesky contacts
- âœ… Community management modal with Bluesky connection
- âœ… Manage Community button opens modal
- âœ… Create Event button redirects with community context

## Issues to Fix Tomorrow

### 1. Make Bluesky Connection Global and Persistent
**Problem**: Currently each modal has duplicate Bluesky code and connection state isn't shared
**Goal**: Create a centralized Bluesky manager that works across all contexts

**Current duplicate code locations**:
- `/templates/event-management-modal.php` - Lines ~750-320 (connection functions)
- `/templates/community-management-modal.php` - Lines ~1057-1147 (duplicate connection modal)

### 2. Fix "Load Bluesky Contacts" Button
**Problem**: Fails in community context - function references don't exist
**Specific issue**: `loadCommunityBlueskyContacts()` function calls may be broken

### 3. Implementation Plan

#### Step 1: Create Global Bluesky Manager
Create new file: `/includes/class-bluesky-ui-manager.php`
- Centralized connection state tracking
- Global connection modal function
- Shared contact loading/rendering functions
- Cross-context contact data sharing

#### Step 2: Consolidate Functions
Move these functions to global scope:
- `showBlueskyConnectModal()` 
- `loadBlueskyContacts()`
- `renderBlueskyContacts()`
- `checkBlueskyConnection()`

#### Step 3: Update Modal Templates
- Remove duplicate code from both modal templates
- Replace with calls to global functions
- Ensure both event and community contexts work identically

#### Step 4: Add Global UI Indicators
- Show Bluesky connection status in navigation/header
- Persistent "Connected as @handle" indicator
- Global disconnect option

## Technical Notes

### Current Working Architecture
- **Backend**: `class-at-protocol-manager.php` handles tokens, validation, refresh
- **API Client**: `class-bluesky-client.php` handles AT Protocol communication
- **Token Persistence**: Encrypted storage with automatic refresh working perfectly

### AJAX Endpoints (Already Working)
- `partyminder_connect_bluesky` - Connect account
- `partyminder_get_bluesky_contacts` - Fetch follows list
- `partyminder_check_bluesky_connection` - Validate connection
- `partyminder_disconnect_bluesky` - Disconnect account

### Key Files Modified Today
1. `/includes/class-at-protocol-manager.php:228-292` - Added `validate_bluesky_connection()` with automatic token refresh
2. `/templates/single-community-content.php:418,567-573` - Fixed Manage Community button and Create Event button
3. `/templates/community-management-modal.php:1057-1147` - Added duplicate Bluesky connection code (to be consolidated)

### Future Use Cases to Enable
- Member invitations via Bluesky
- Event sharing to Bluesky network
- Community promotion
- Cross-platform identity verification
- Social discovery features

## Development Environment
- **Local**: `/Users/lonnholiday/Local Sites/socialpartyminderlocal/app/public/wp-content/plugins/partyminder/`
- **Symlink**: `/Users/lonnholiday/social.partyminder.com/` â†’ points to local
- **Production**: https://social.partyminder.com (separate deployment)

## User Feedback
> "I needed to reconnect to blue sky every time. Can we make our member's connection to blue sky persistent?" - FIXED âœ…
> "The Manage Community button doesn't work" - FIXED âœ…  
> "Create Event button says coming soon" - FIXED âœ…
> "Load contacts button fails now" - TO FIX TOMORROW ðŸ”„

## Success Metrics
When complete, users should be able to:
1. Connect to Bluesky once and stay connected across all contexts
2. Access their contacts from any invitation interface
3. See consistent Bluesky integration everywhere
4. Use Bluesky for multiple features beyond just event invites
