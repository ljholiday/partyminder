> You were supposed to be doing this:

  Here’s a precise, low-risk sequence you can hand to the team. Short answer to your direct question: update the database 
  schema first, then enable default personal-community creation for new members, then backfill existing users, then wire up 
  circles and feeds.

  # Step-by-step plan

  ## 0) Prep and guards

  1. Create a feature flag set:

     * `circles_schema`
     * `personal_community_new_users`
     * `personal_community_backfill`
     * `general_convo_default_to_personal`
     * `reply_join_flow`
     * `circles_resolver`
     * `convo_feed_by_circle`
     * `circles_nav_ui`
  2. Branch off dev, prepare a rollback plan for each flag. Ship incrementally.

  ## 1) Schema first (non-breaking migration)

  3. Add columns to `communities`:

     * `personal_owner_user_id BIGINT NULL` (FK to users) - null for normal communities, set for personal ones.
     * `visibility ENUM('public','followers','private') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'public'`.
     * Indexes: `(creator_user_id)`, `(personal_owner_user_id)`, `(visibility)`.
  4. Add optional column to `community_members`:

     * `status ENUM('member','pending','blocked') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'member'` for followers/private flows.
     * Composite index `(community_id, user_id)` if not present; add `(user_id)` for reverse lookups.
  5. Verify/ensure:

     * `conversations(community_id, created_at)` indexed.
     * `replies(conversation_id, created_at)` indexed.
  6. Deploy migration. Turn on `circles_schema` flag.

  ## 2) Personal communities for new users

  7. Implement `PersonalCommunityService::create_for_user($user_id)`:

     * Create community with `personal_owner_user_id = $user_id`, `creator_user_id = $user_id`, `visibility = 'public'` 
  (default), slug like `@username` or `pc_{user_id}`.
     * Add creator as `community_members.member`.
  8. Hook into user registration:

     * On `user_register`, call the service.
  9. Enable `personal_community_new_users` flag. QA with a new signup.

  ## 3) Backfill existing users safely

  10. Write idempotent job `personal_community_backfill`:

      * For each existing user without a personal community, create one via the service.
      * Rate limit batches to avoid lock pressure.
  11. Enable `personal_community_backfill` flag and run the job. Verify counts and indexes.

  ## 4) General conversations become personal by default

  12. Update conversation creation path:

      * If no community is selected, target the author’s personal community by default.
  13. Data migration for legacy general conversations (only if such rows exist):

      * For any conversation lacking a community or using a deprecated “general” bucket, move to the author’s personal 
  community.
      * Keep IDs stable; if URLs change, add redirects.
  14. Enable `general_convo_default_to_personal`. Verify new posts land in personal communities.

  ## 5) Reply join flow for personal communities

  15. Implement reply-time membership logic:

      * Public personal community: non-member reply triggers auto-join then posts.
      * Followers: create `community_members` with `status='pending'`; block posting until approved, or cache a draft and 
  notify.
      * Private: show request access; no posting.
  16. Add per-community setting: “allow auto-join on reply” (default on for public).
  17. Enable `reply_join_flow`. QA spam limits and UX.

  ## 6) Circles resolver based on your rules

  18. Implement `CirclesResolver::creator_sets($viewer_id)` respecting your definitions:

      * Inner communities: communities created by the viewer.

        * `inner_creators = {viewer_id}`
      * Trusted communities: communities created by anyone who is a member of any Inner community.

        * `trusted_member_ids = members_of(inner_communities)`
        * `trusted_creators = creators_of_communities_created_by(trusted_member_ids)`
      * Extended communities: communities created by anyone who is a member of any Trusted community.

        * `extended_member_ids = members_of(trusted_communities)`
        * `extended_creators = creators_of_communities_created_by(extended_member_ids)`
      * Cache per viewer for 60–120s. Guard for cycles; de-dup sets.
  19. Return sets of community IDs and/or creator IDs for quick filtering. Add small metrics to watch set sizes.
  20. Enable `circles_resolver` in dev and verify outputs on seeded data.

  ## 7) Feed queries with permission gates

  21. Build feed query `ConversationFeed::list($viewer_id, $circle, $opts)`:

      * Resolve creator set from resolver.
      * Select conversations where `community.creator_user_id IN set` and the viewer passes permissions:

        * `community.visibility='public'` OR viewer is `community_members.member` OR event/community specific rules.
      * Sort by latest activity (max(reply.created\_at, conversation.created\_at)).
      * Paginate, preload authors, communities, and latest reply snippet.
  22. Add “why visible” markers for each item using circle classification.
  23. Enable `convo_feed_by_circle` for admin accounts first; verify performance.

  ## 8) UI: secondary button nav

  24. Add the 3-button secondary nav to Dashboard and Conversations page:

      * Close Circle, Trusted Circle, Extended Circle. Default Close.
      * Wire to AJAX endpoint that calls `ConversationFeed::list`.
  25. Add empty, loading, and error states. A11y: `aria-pressed` or `aria-selected` toggles, polite live region.
  26. Enable `circles_nav_ui` and test end to end.

  ## 9) Dashboard “All replies” stream

  27. Implement the top-of-dashboard “All replies”:

      * Compose three lists in memory: inner, trusted, extended, each sorted by recent activity, then concatenate.
      * Or run one query with CASE sort to prioritize by circle rank.
  28. Show the secondary nav directly beneath to filter explicitly.

  ## 10) Admin tools and moderation levers

  29. Add per-community visibility control on personal communities: public, followers, private.
  30. Add moderation tools for pending followers and rate limit for auto-join on reply.

  ## 11) Analytics and safety nets

  31. Log circle sizes, fetch times, cache hit rates, and result counts.
  32. Add a hard cap per circle result window (for example 1,000 communities) to prevent runaway expansion in pathological 
  graphs.
  33. Add a hard cap per feed request (page size) and a time budget.

  ## 12) QA matrix

  34. Scenarios to test:

      * Brand new user with no friends: sees own personal community content; onboarding prompts.
      * Small network: verify Trusted and Extended expansion is correct and stable.
      * Visibility modes: public, followers (pending), private.
      * Reply join flow in each mode.
      * Migration correctness: legacy posts now in personal communities, no orphaned links.
      * Performance at 100k conversations: indexes behave, caches help.

  ## 13) Rollout order

  35. Production enablement sequence:

      * `circles_schema` → `personal_community_new_users` → `personal_community_backfill`
      * `general_convo_default_to_personal` → `reply_join_flow`
      * `circles_resolver` → `convo_feed_by_circle` → `circles_nav_ui`
  36. Monitor, then widen exposure. Keep flags in place until metrics are steady.

  ---

  ## Notes on your definitions and why this order

  * Schema must land first so personal communities can exist. Then creation for new users prevents more backfill later. Then 
  backfill everyone else once you know creation is solid. Only after every user has a personal community should you default 
  general conversations and migrate legacy ones. The resolver and feeds come after the data model is stable, and UI comes last 
  so you do not expose an empty or inconsistent feed.
